#Paragraph 1:
As Buzz the Buzzard began to grow, he became more and more curious.
Soon his curiosity lead him away from home to a strange new place, a place without the love of his family.
It didn’t take Buzz long to realize what he was missing and what he really wanted.

#Paragraph 2:
“Welcome stranger. I’m Buzz the Buzzard.You must be here for some advice. 
But I have to tell you- the old water hole has dried up, there’s no fast food restaurants, and the closest hotel is 100 miles due South.
Now, how can I be of assistance?

#Paragraph 3:
Ah, I understand. 
You’re just waiting for the Red Rock Tour Bus.
Then you saw me, and decided to have a closer look. Well, while you are here, let me give you some advice.
It’s free!

#Paragraph 4:
There is nothing more important than your family.
That’s it. 

#Paragraph 5:
Oh, I guess I could add that friends could be considered your family.
Your family doesn’t just have to be your mom and dad, or step-parents, or brother, or sisters or cousins, aunts and uncles.
Well, you get the idea.
Your family is all the people who love you and all those you love.

#Paragraph 6:
What’s that, little one? 
How do I know? 
Well, it is a long and sad story but I will make it short since I see your bus coming down the road.

#Paragraph 7:
Not long ago, the sky around these parts was full of Buzzards.
Yep, my family.
One day I decided that living out here just wasn’t enough.
I wanted to go to the big city.

#Paragraph 8:
Now my family begged me to stay.
They told me how much they loved me, how much they needed me, they reminded me of all the good times. 
But I didn’t listen.

#Paragraph 9:
Off to the big city I went.

#Paragraph 10:
But it wasn’t long before I knew that I had made a mistake.
No one loved me in the big city. 
I had no family and I was all alone.
But I was lucky because I could just flap my wings and head back home.
Back home to my family. 
And that’s just what I did.

#Paragraph 11:
I don’t know what happened but when I got home there was no one to greet me.
No family, no friends, just empty space.

#Paragraph 12:
Oh, I see your bus is here so go on, get along, but remember - there is nothing more important than your family.” 

#Paragraph 13:
The bus pulled up, came to a stop, the doors opened, and Buzz‘s family stepped out carrying souvenirs from the big city.
“We all went looking for you and are we glad you’re home,”
Betty Buzzard said with a smile.
