#Paragraph 1:
On a huge mountain, in a big forest, there was a medium sized meadow and a small pond. in this small pond lived terrance, the turtle and his
two best buddies, sam and sally swan.

#Paragraph 2:
Oh, you may think it odd that a turtle and swans were buddies, really true friends, but i assure you â€“ they were. every day the three of them
would search the pond for food, swim together and play games, and tell stories on the shore. when it got dark, sam and sally would return to their
nest under a large tree and terrance to his den on the shore, by their tree.
