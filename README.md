## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to understand how children's picture books illustrate pictures with language. By analyzing a collection of texts from children's picture books, we aim to gain insights into the relationship between the textual elements and the accompanying illustrations.

## Scope

This corpus consists of texts extracted from children's picture books. The focus is on capturing the language used in captions, story text, and dialogue within the books.

## Metadata

Date: The date when the corpus was created or last updated.

Author: The primary author or authors of the corpus.

Language: The language(s) of the texts in the corpus.

Source: The source(s) from where the texts were obtained.

Publisher: The publisher(s) of the picture books included in the corpus.

Age-group: The intended age group or reading level of the picture books.

## File Format

Each file in the corpus should be stored as plain text format (.txt). This format ensures compatibility and ease of use for various text analysis tools and techniques.

## File Organization

Please name each file using the following format: textX_title of the book.txt, where X is a unique identifier for each book. For example: text1_Where the Wild Things Are.txt.


## Usage

Researchers, linguists, educators, and practitioners interested in studying children's literature, language development, or the interaction between language and visual elements can use this corpus for analysis. 

The corpus can be accessed by cloning or downloading this repository, and individual text files can be used for further research.
