Text8: 
On Monday, I went fishing with my dad.
He caught a big one, I was sad.
On Tuesday, we fished  a different spot.
He caught another and I did not.
On Wednesday, we fished a different lake.
The fish were  there for him to take.
Thursday came and we hit the river.
He caught  five, I got a sliver.
On Friday I told him, I needed a rest.
He said, “Let’s go, and give it your best.”
Saturday came and he caught more.
I tried so hard, my arms were sore.
Sunday morning we were there very fast.
I baited my hook and made a cast.
A tug on my line, my reel was screaming.
I caught a fish, my eyes were gleaming.
When I got it to the boat.
We were amazed to see.
The biggest fish in the lake was caught by me!
